        <td>The pursuit of Happiness</td>
        <td>
            Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as a "bone density scanner". 
            He feels like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not sell well as they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. 
            As Gardner works to make ends meet, his wife leaves him and he loses his apartment. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner continues to 
            sell bone density scanners while concurrently taking on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim chances for advancement to a paid position. 
            Before he can receive pay, he needs to outshine the competition through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices to stay afloat.

            Jake Tyler has recently moved from Iowa to Orlando, Florida with his mother, Margret and younger brother Charlie who is a budding Tennis star, 
            the move being in furtherance of his tennis career. His father died in a drunk-driving car crash accident, which is the subject of taunting from other classmates.
             He has a rising reputation with the students of his new school due to an internet video of him when he was a football player at his previous school fighting with 
             a frustrated opponent player who makes derogatory remarks about Jake's father. Initially Jake has trouble fitting into his new school and while walking he sees 
             Max Cooperman supposedly being beaten up by bullies. When Jake tries to intervene, he is told off by Max and his friends as the "bullying" was actually a consensual 
             mixed martial arts fight. Later on, Jake is invited by classmate Baja Miller (whom he develops a crush on) to a party where he is unwillingly pulled into a fight with 
             the MMA champion at the school, Ryan McCarthy, who is also Baja's boyfriend. Initially refusing to fight, Jake readily agrees to fight Ryan when he makes fun of Jake's 
             father's death. Ryan easily defeats Jake, and video of the event circulates the school which leaves Jake humiliated.

            The Social Network is undoubtedly one of the smartest movies of the decade. Directed by David Fincher, the film follows Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) 
            as he forms Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits filed against him by his CFO for unfair share dilution and The Winklevoss twins for intellectual property theft. 
            Fast-paced, engrossing and visually striking, the film is splendid in its execution. Although it is characterized as a biographical drama, it rather fits the modern 
            emerging template of intellectual thrillers. Though it is a unique viewing experience unlike any other, the following films have created a similar experience based on their idea, \
            plot execution, and themes. With that said, hereâ€™s the list of movies similar to The Social Network that are our recommendations.
